description: OSF provides free and open source project management support for researchers
  across the entire research lifecycle. As a collaboration tool, OSF helps researchers
  work on projects privately with a limited number of collaborators and make parts
  of their projects public, or make all the project publicly accessible for broader
  dissemination. As a workflow system, OSF enables connections to the many services
  researchers already use to streamline their process and increase efficiency. As
  a flexible repository, it can store and archive research data, protocols, and materials.

  description: |-
    List of view only links on a node.
    ####Returns
    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

    The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 view only links. Each resource in the array is a view only link object.

    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

    ####Permissions

    View only links on a node, public or private, are readable and writeable only by users that are administrators on the node.

    ####Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include view only links that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/view_only_links/?filter[anonymous]=true.

    View Only Links may be filtered based on their `name`, `anonymous` and `date_created` fields. Possible comparison operators include 'gt' (greater than), 'gte'(greater than or equal to), 'lt' (less than) and 'lte' (less than or equal to). The date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and the time is optional.
